# Bike-Sales-Case-Study
This project aims to provide insights on bike sales data to understand the distribution of sales.

Welcome to the Bike Sales data analysis case study as a part of the Portfolio Project of DataAnalyzer-Pooja. 

# About Dataset

# Findings
- Middle aged customers (31-54 years) buy the most bikes followed by old aged customers (54 years or above) and finally adolescents (30 years or below).
- Customers with shorter commutes (0-1 miles) buy the most bikes, while those with longer commutes (more than 10 miles)  buy the least.
- Customers in North America buy the most bikes.
- Married male customers buy the most bikes. 
- Customers with a bachelor's degree buy the most bikes, while those with a partial high school degree buy the least. 

I hope this project helps you understand the bike sales distribution. If you have any questions or suggestions, please don't hesitate to reach out.
